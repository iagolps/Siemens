Answer for question 6.

For practicality, the file "Q6_Tables.sql" containes the query that creates the tables needed for this exercise.

In the file "Q6.sql", was developed a query that will generate the desired report with three columns: Name, Grade, and Value. It uses a combination of conditional statements, subqueries, and ordering to achieve the desired result.

The CASE statement is used to handle the condition where the grade is less than 8 and replaces the name with "NULL" in those cases.

The JOIN operation is used to match the value in the Students table with the corresponding grade range in the Notes table.

The WHERE clause filters the students who received a grade higher than or equal to 8 or those who received a grade of 7 but fall within the range specified in the Notes table.

The ORDER BY clause sorts the results first by grade in descending order, then by name in ascending order for grades 8-10, and finally by value in ascending order for grades 1-7.
