Answer for question 15.

In Qt, a signal is a mechanism for communication between objects. It is used to notify other objects about events or changes that have occurred.

In the example by using QObject::connect(), I connect the button's clicked signal to the buttonClicked() slot of MyObject.

This means that whenever the button is clicked, the slot function will be executed, and the debug message "Button clicked!" will be printed.
