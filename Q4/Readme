Answer for question 4.

The code consist of a function ConcatRemove, that returns a string.

In line 9 I find the length of the common prefix of s and t

In line 13 I calculate the number of operations needed to convert s to t

In line 15 I check if it's possible to convert s to t using exactly k operations

In line 22 I write the main function to prompt to input values for s, t and k. Then, it calls function ConcatRemove and prints the result.

The input is assumed to be correctly formatted.

Run it with:

g++ -Wall -g -Wa,-mbig-obj -std=c++11 Q4.cpp -o Q4.exe

./Q4.exe
